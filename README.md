**Create your own redux**

ðŸ‘‹ hi there! this repo is to show how simple is redux & how can you create you own implementation in less than 35 LOC.

***

It has two([redux](https://github.com/kuldeepkeshwar/redux-playground/tree/master/src/redux) & [react-redux](https://github.com/kuldeepkeshwar/redux-playground/tree/master/src/react-redux)) packages.

*** `redux` exposes `createStore` & `applyMiddleware`

*** `react-redux` comes with `Provider` component & `connect` HOF

***happy hacking !!***
